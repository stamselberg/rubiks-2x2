# Rubik's 2x2 Solver - React App

This React app is part of a larger project aimed at solving the Rubik's 2x2 cube.
So far, it only allows users to interact with the cube, toggling the colors of its faces. A solver is to be added on top, integrated from one of the other project folders.
The design showcases how to build up simple 3D objects made up of smaller parts.
